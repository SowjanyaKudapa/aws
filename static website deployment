create any server - launch instance
after launching go to security groups and add http for webserver and add ssh protocol for linux.
then launch the server 
update that - yum update
yum install apache2
syatemctl start apache2
chmod 777 /vvv/www/html
then open in sftp(port num:22) launch that server.
delete that file inside the html 
then go to anywebsite template and drag that web templates into that /var/www/html
then go to ssh 
write the command "systemctl restart apavhe2"

take public ip of that server and put in on the browser it gives the appliaction deployment.

but in ubuntu we have having that facility to connect in both ssh and sftp
in amazon apache2 is not supports
