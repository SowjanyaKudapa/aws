Solid state drives (SSD) and hard disk drives (HDD) are data storage devices. SSDs store data in flash memory, while HDDs store data in magnetic disks. 
SDD:
====
ssd uses semi conductor material to store the data and data is accessed electronically. high speed
Consumes less power, making them more suitable for laptops and portable devices.
more expensive
HDD:
====
hdd uses magnetic disks and A read/write head moves over the platters to access data. low speed.
Consumes more power due to mechanical movement.
cost is less


HDD Uses:
==========
Mass Storage:
Ideal for large data storage needs, such as media files (videos, photos, music).

Backup:
Used for backup solutions where cost-effectiveness is important.

Desktops:
Commonly used in desktops where space and power consumption are less of a concern.

Servers:
Used in servers for applications requiring large amounts of storage.

SSD Uses:
==========
Operating System and Software:
Ideal for running operating systems, applications, and software that benefit from fast read/write speeds.

Laptops and Ultrabooks:
Preferred in portable devices due to lower power consumption, durability, and speed.

Gaming:
Used in gaming PCs and consoles for faster load times and improved performance.

High-Performance Workstations:
Used in workstations for tasks requiring high-speed data access, such as video editing, 3D rendering, and large database management.

Data Centers:
Increasingly used in data centers for high-speed access and reduced latency in data-intensive applications.
